Select PI.ProductID, ST.TransactionID, PI.Price, ST.Price
From product_inventory PI
join sales_transaction_noduplicate ST on PI.ProductID = ST.ProductID 
where PI.Price <> ST.Price ;

-- Now time to correct (update) wrong prices :- 
UPDATE sales_transaction_noduplicate st
JOIN product_inventory pi
    ON st.ProductID = pi.ProductID
SET st.Price = pi.Price
WHERE st.Price <> pi.Price;


-- 3. Take care of missing values :- (To identify the null values in dataset and change it with 'Unknown')
select count(*) as "NULL"
from customer_profiles 
where  Age is null 
or CustomerID is null
or Gender is null
or Location = ""
or JoinDate is null;

-- Find missing values for every or specific columns :- 
SELECT 
    sum(case when CustomerID = "" then 1 else 0 End) as CustomerID_null,

join sales_transaction_cdate_nodup st
on st.ProductID = pi.ProductID
group by pi.ProductID, pi.ProductName, pi.Category
order by Total_sales Desc;
